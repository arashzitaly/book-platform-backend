## 🧱 Architecture

This project follows a **microservices architecture**:

- **Auth Service** – Manages users and authentication
- **Facility Service** – Handles facility and category logic
- **Resource Service** – Manages physical resources (e.g., tables, classes)
- **Slot Service** – Manages available times for bookings
- **Booking Service** – Handles reservations
- **Notification Service** – (Planned) for sending notifications

All services are independently scalable, containerized, and follow clean API principles.
