          ## Project point-in-time status
          - The CI workflow runs on every push and pull request to any branch.
          - The pipeline currently consists of four sequential jobs (`check`, `test`, `build`, and `report`).
          - The `test` and `build` stages only emit placeholder messages and do not execute automated tests or builds yet.

          ## What this build committed
          - This report is generated on each CI run and reflects the workflow status at build time.

          ## What we have done in this build
          - Captured the current CI workflow behavior and noted the absence of automated tests/build steps.
          - Produced a concise report that can be updated as the pipeline evolves.
